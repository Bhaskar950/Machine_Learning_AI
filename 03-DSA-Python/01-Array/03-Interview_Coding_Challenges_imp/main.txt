Here are ten commonly asked array-based coding challenges that are frequently encountered in interviews:


Two Sum: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.


Maximum Subarray: Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.


Longest Consecutive Sequence: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.


Product of Array Except Self: Given an array nums, return an array such that each element at index i of the output array is the product of all the numbers in the input array except nums[i].


Rotate Array: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.


Find Duplicate Number: Given an array of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive) where n is the size of the array, find the duplicate number.


Container With Most Water: Given an array where each element represents the height of a vertical line, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water.


Merge Intervals: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.


3Sum: Given an array of integers, find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.


Subarray Sum Equals K: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.


These challenges cover a range of difficulty levels and are excellent for testing your understanding of arrays and problem-solving skills.
