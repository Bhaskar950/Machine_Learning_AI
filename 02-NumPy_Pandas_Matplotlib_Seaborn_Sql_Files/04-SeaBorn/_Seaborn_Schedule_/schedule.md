Certainly! Here’s a 7-day schedule to cover Seaborn from October 11 to October 17, with 3 hours of study each day. This schedule will help you learn the basics, advanced features, and practical applications of Seaborn.

7-Day Seaborn Study Schedule

Day 1 (October 11): Introduction to Seaborn

Overview of Seaborn
Installing and setting up Seaborn
Basic plotting (scatter plots, line plots)
Practice: Create basic scatter and line plots using sample data

Day 2 (October 12): Data Visualization Basics

Plotting distributions (histograms, KDE plots)
Understanding and using sns.histplot, sns.kdeplot
Practice: Visualize the distribution of different datasets

Day 3 (October 13): Categorical Data Visualization

Creating categorical plots (bar plots, box plots, violin plots)
Using sns.barplot, sns.boxplot, sns.violinplot
Practice: Visualize categorical data and compare distributions

Day 4 (October 14): Advanced Visualization Techniques

Creating pair plots and heatmaps
Using sns.pairplot, sns.heatmap
Customizing plots with color palettes and style settings
Practice: Generate pair plots and heatmaps for complex datasets

Day 5 (October 15): Statistical Visualization

Plotting regression lines and confidence intervals with sns.regplot, sns.lmplot
Understanding and using sns.residplot
Practice: Apply statistical plots to analyze relationships between variables

Day 6 (October 16): Practical Exercise

Project: Develop a comprehensive data visualization report using Seaborn. Analyze a dataset and create various plots to present insights effectively.
Choose a dataset (e.g., health data, financial data)
Perform data analysis and visualization using Seaborn
Present findings with different types of plots and visual styles

Day 7 (October 17): Final Review and Consolidation

Review all concepts covered during the week
Refine and finalize the project
Reflect on how Seaborn integrates with data analysis and machine learning projects
